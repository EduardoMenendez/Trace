## 🚀 Getting Started

### ✅ Prerequisites

Before you can run the project, make sure you have the following installed:

- [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/)
  - After installation, **start Docker Desktop** so the Docker daemon is running.
  - On Windows, make sure Docker is configured to use **WSL 2** or **Hyper-V**.

> **⚠️ IMPORTANT:** After installing Docker Desktop, you must **start Docker Desktop manually** or set it to run on login.  
> On Windows, open the Start menu and launch **Docker Desktop**. Wait until you see the whale icon in the system tray and it says "Docker Desktop is running."
